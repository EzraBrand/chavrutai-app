# ChavrutAI

ChavrutAI will be an interactive tool for studying Talmud with AI-assisted tools. 

The application will provides access to traditional Talmud texts along with additional curated AI-generated overviews, background, summmaries, and collaborative learning features.

## Project Overview

- Access and navigate Talmud in an optiized way.
- Receive AI-assisted overview, summaries, tables, and visualizations
- Engage in a virtual chavruta experience
