# ChavrutAI

ChavrutAI will be an interactive tool for studying Talmud with AI-assisted tools. 

The application will provides access to traditional Talmud texts along with additional curated AI-generated overviews, background, summmaries, and collaborative learning features.

## Project Overview

ChavrutAI brings the traditional Jewish learning partnership ("chavruta") into the digital age by combining ancient texts with modern AI technology. This application will enable users to:

- Access and navigate Talmud in an optiized way.
- Receive AI-assisted overview, summaries, tables, and visualizations
- Engage in a virtual chavruta experience

## About Me
I'm an amateur hobby coder. In my day job, I have extensive experience with advanced spreadsheets. 
On the side, I've built a number of tools for digital humanities purposes, mostly using Google Colab notebooks. 
Recently, I've been working especially with React, Github Codespaces, Vercel, and API querying. 
This current project is my biggest project yet.
